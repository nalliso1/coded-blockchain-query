# Coded Blockchain Based Range Queries

This project implements a coded blockchain system that enables efficient range queries on historical data while reducing per-node storage. By using error correction codes and distributed indexing, the system provides fault tolerance, scalability, and practical support for querying data ranges without storing the full chain.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The system fragments blockchain data using Reed-Solomon encoding and distributes coded fragments across nodes. This reduces storage requirements at each node by 60% while still allowing complete block reconstruction from a subset of fragments. A B+ tree index enables efficient range queries on block attributes without needing to scan the entire blockchain.

For a detailed explanation of the system design, implementation, and evaluation, read our full [CS4545 Final Report](./CS4545_Final_Report.pdf).

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Coded Storage**: Uses Reed-Solomon codes to encode and distribute fragments with built-in redundancy.
- **Range Queries**: Supports efficient range lookups using a distributed B+ tree index.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Blocks can be reconstructed from any 3 out of 5 fragments (40% redundancy).
- **Distributed Architecture**: Nodes communicate via Flask-based REST APIs for fragment storage and retrieval.

## ðŸ“Œ My Contributions

This project was developed collaboratively by our team of three for the CS4545 course. We all participated in the design discussions, system testing, and performance evaluation. 

I contributed to:
- Implementing the node server and node manager components
- Developed the system evaluation framework
- Created the data loading & preprocessing utilities
- Authoring the project report and documentation
